# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game that plays user vs computer.Since it was my first attempt to make an automated game, I have used high level data analysis and intensive machine learning (jk,lol ). I have just tried to build some logic by using number of if else statements and worked my way out with some functions. I would LOVE to have any kind of assistance and am open to any kind of help to improve the code.
